     <ul> <li><h3> Ingredents</h3> </ul>
      <ul>
          <li>2 cups flour, all purpose or plain</li>
          <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, or dutch process for richer muffins</li>
          <li>3/4 cup light brown sugar, packed</li>
          <li>3/4 cup white granulated sugar</li>
          <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>8 oz semi-sweet, dark or milk chocolate, roughly chopped and divided</li>
          <li>2/3 cup cooking oil</li>
          <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
          <li>3/4 cup sour cream</li>
          <li>3/4 cup buttermilk</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>  <li><h3> Steps</h3> </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 425ºF (220°C). Lightly grease a standard 12-cup muffin pan with butter or cooking oil spray.</li>
          <li>In a large bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, white sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir in 3/4 of the chocolate chunks and coat in the dry mixture so they don't sink to the bottom while baking.</li>
          <li>Make a well in the middle and add in oil, eggs, sour cream, buttermilk and vanilla. Whisk the wet ingredients vigorously first, then use a wooden spoon to fold the wet mixture into the dry ingredients, until some of the bigger lumps have been smoothed out. The batter will be thick.</li>
          <li>Spoon the batter evenly into the prepared muffin cups just over 3/4 full (give the tops room to rise). Top with the remaining chocolate chunks.</li>
          <li>Bake muffins in the hot oven for about 8 minutes at 425°F (220°C), until muffins have puffed up slightly above muffin tray. Then reduce oven heat to 350ºF (175°C). Do NOT open oven when reducing temperature. Bake for a further 10-12 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the centre of one comes out clean. The tops should be firm to the touch.</li>
          <li>Let muffins cool slightly in the pan (about 10 minutes) then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
